This album captures the vibrant soul of Kathmandu, Nepal—a city where ancient traditions and modern energy collide. From the bustling streets of Thamel, illuminated by neon lights and lined with eclectic shops, to the serene spiritual spaces of temples and monasteries, each photograph tells a story of contrast and harmony.

You'll see the warmth of the local people, the quiet contemplation at sacred sites, and the mischievous gaze of temple monkeys perched above the city. The fluttering prayer flags at Swayambhunath and the rhythmic spin of prayer wheels evoke a timeless spirituality, while the narrow alleyways and markets reveal the pulse of everyday life.

A visual journey through Kathmandu’s rich textures, intricate rituals, and electric atmosphere—this collection is an invitation to explore the magic of Nepal’s capital through my lens.
