I build things, break things, and make sure they work better after.  

Most days, you’ll find me diving into security systems, figuring out how to make them bulletproof. Some people call it DevSecOps. I call it making sure stuff doesn’t fall apart.

## What I Actually Do  

- **Find the gaps**: The stuff most people miss? That’s what I look for.  
- **Fix the mess**: Automate what’s slow, secure what’s weak, and simplify what’s annoying.  
- **Keep things running**: I like it when everything just *works*.

## When I’m Not Working  

- 🧗 Climbing walls (sometimes mountains, sometimes metaphorical).  
- 🎮 Gaming late at night—preferably something dark and immersive.  
- 📚 Digging into weird books or random rabbit holes.  
- 🛠 Tinkering with side projects that make zero sense but are fun anyway.

## Tech Stuff (If You Care About That)  

I’m pretty comfortable with all of this:  

- **Code**: Python, Go, JavaScript  
- **Tools**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform  
- **Security**: GuardDuty, Nessus, Burp Suite  
- **Frameworks**: NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR
